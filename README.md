# Planner-App

Deployed Appliation can be found at : https://exxtremebattler.github.io/planner-app/

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a program that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

Through this project, I learnt a lot about Javascript, and how to ensure a program's logic is as sharp as possible.

## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

To use the program, click on a textarea to add an event. Click 'Save' to save the event so it persists between refreshes/reloads.

RED textareas mean the relevant time has already passed. 
A BLUE textarea means the relevant time is now.
GREEN textareas mean the relevant time is in the future.
